# IndustrialHard = Minecraft and Factorio parody

IndustrialHard would be about: 
- Building massive buildings, exploring and survive wild realistic world
- Building your factory to Flying out to moon to accomplish your child dream (end goal for now)

Right now it's unplayable stone simulator written in CPP+OpenGL+GLAD+SDL+glm+...


# Compile & run:
- Make sure dependencies are installed (sdl3, opengl, glad, glm) (I recommend using `vcpkg install glm` and etc)
- Build with cmake
- Before running, make sure SDL3.dll is located inside build folder (Important!)
- ??? Profit

# Dependencies:
- OpenGL 4.4+
